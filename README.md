## Preparation for the workshop (25-Sep-20)  

### Installing R and RStudio  

If you haven't already done so, [install first R](https://www.r-project.org/), then [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) on your computer. That way you can try out the code we'll cover during the practice breaks. Of course, you may choose to just follow the presentation.  

### Accessing R/Rstudio Server  

If you prefer to access RStudio Server online, please go to [https://stats3.sgul.ac.uk/rstudio/](https://stats3.sgul.ac.uk/rstudio/).  
Note that you will need a good amount of disk space allowance for your H drive.  
You might need to first connect to the university's VPN or open the tool on [mydesktop](mydesktop.sgul.ac.uk).
